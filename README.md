- 👋 Hi, I’m @colinpiegore
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about what exactly github is and how it works. I'm also interested in learning various programming languages such as C++, Python, Ruby, and Java.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about what github is and how it works. Maybe I'm just ignorant but I feel as though even the dependabot is smarter than me when it comes to github.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various things.
- 📫 How to reach me: email address is cjpiegore@gmail.com
